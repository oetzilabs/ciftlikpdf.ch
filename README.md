# My Dev Webpage

This webapp will be my entry point of my current projects that use [SST](https://sst.dev) as the IaC.

You can visit the page at [oetzi.dev](https://oetzi.dev).

I will try to update the page as frequent as possible. 

## What can you expect from the page?

I will try to use the page to template and create my website projects with [sst](https://sst.dev)

## Roadmap

Currently I have some ideas that I want to accomplish with the webapp, I will release a list of them here shortly.

## Contributions

I don't know if I have the time to see through the issues and other parts of the individual projects. This app is currently "broken" so I have to priorities my efforts into fixing those issues I already know.
