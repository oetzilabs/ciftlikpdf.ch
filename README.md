# CiftlikPDF

This is a webapp for some users of the Village Ciftlik KÃ¶y from Turkey.

I made this webapp within a couple days to make the process of creating PDFs based on user input easier.

This project is made with [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com/), [SST](https://sst.dev), [turso](https://turso.tech), Golang (to create PDFs) and AWS.
